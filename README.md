#### Project details: 
This is a React app project. HTML, Vanilla CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, and GitHub are the primary expertise. For the additional feature, I have used React-hot-toast, React-photo-view, React-scroll-animation, React-router-dom, and React-spinners. I tried to keep the code simple and organized.
